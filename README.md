### RECOMENDATION
Below are my Recommendations.

1. The Bottom Performing Regions have Less Countries prescence hence I will Recommend that the Company Extend their Product to more of this Regions and Create more Awareness.
2. The Top Performing Items such as Office Supply,Household and Comestic should be Invested In because this Items have continuously come Top in terms of Revenue,But More attention should be Paid to Comestic as this Item is the Top performing Item in terms of Profit and as the lowest Cost among this 3.
This in a way can help cut down on the cost.
3. The Country with the lowwest Cost and Highest profit is Central Africa,More Sales Awareness should be Increase in this Country.
